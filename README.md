Face-Based Attendance System
Overview
The Face-Based Attendance System is an advanced application that utilizes facial recognition technology to streamline the attendance tracking process. This system is designed to offer a more efficient, accurate, and secure method for recording attendance, eliminating the need for traditional methods like manual sign-ins or card swipes.

Features
Automated Attendance: Automatically records attendance using facial recognition.
High Accuracy: Employs state-of-the-art facial recognition algorithms to ensure accurate identification.
User Management: Allows administrators to manage user profiles and attendance records.
Real-time Monitoring: Provides real-time attendance updates and notifications.
Secure and Reliable: Ensures data security and reliability with robust encryption and database management.
Technology Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React)
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Facial Recognition: Python, OpenCV, dlib
Database: MongoDB (or another NoSQL database)
Deployment: Docker, Kubernetes
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm installed
Python 3.x installed
MongoDB installed and running
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-based-attendance.git
cd face-based-attendance
Install frontend dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd frontend

Set Up Facial Recognition Model:

Follow the instructions in the model/README.md file to set up the facial recognition model.

Run the Application:

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to start using the application.

Usage
User Registration: Administrators can register users by capturing their facial images and storing their profiles in the system.
Attendance Recording: Users simply look at the camera to have their attendance recorded automatically.
View Attendance Records: Administrators and users can view and manage attendance records through the web interface.
